#Basic Programming for Programmers
-Colored text means that RobotC recognises the text created.

-Lines and spaces are not read in the program, they are used for the programmer's organization.

-Semicolons such as ; are used to beguin and end a statement that the program reads.

-When there are no more statements to run, the program ends.

-Pair Punctuation such as paranthesis ( ) and squared brackets [ ] are used to mark special meaning to the command that it is a part of. For example, motor[port3] and wait1Msec(3000).

-Two slashes such as // are left by the programmer to let other programmers know what exactly the function is or what is going on.

-Control Sturctures is what makes the Robot think and flow the code together such as While ____, If this then _____, else then ____. Simple statements are done in order, however Control Structures lets the robot decdie what goes next.

-Task Main() in RobotC decides what program the robot is running. The Task Main surrounds the program in  swirly braces { }

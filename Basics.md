#Basic Programming for Programmers
-Colored text means that RobotC recognises the text created.

-Lines and spaces are not read in the program, they are used for the programmer's organization.

-Semicolons such as ; are used to beguin and end a statement that the program reads.

-When there are no more statements to run, the program ends.

-Pair Punctuation such as paranthesis ( ) and squared brackets [ ] are used to mark special meaning to the command that it is a part of.

-Two slashes such as // are left by the programmer to let other programmers know what exactly the function is or what is going on.
